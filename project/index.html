    <h2 >A small description about the anime Durarara</h2>
    <p>Durarara!! (デュラララ!!), often shortened to DRRR!!, is a Japanese light novel series written by Ryohgo Narita, with illustrations by Suzuhito Yasuda, that has also been adapted into a Japanese anime series. Durarara!! tells the story of a dullahan working as an underworld courier in Ikebukuro, an internet-based anonymous gang called The Dollars, and the chaos that unfolds around the most dangerous people in Ikebukuro. The series ran for thirteen volumes, published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint.</p>
    <br>
    <p>~A small peek on the novel~</p>
    <p>In Ikebukuro, Tokyo, strange groups of people gather: youths who yearn for an extraordinary life, trouble-making hooligans, crazy stalker girls, informants who sell information for their own enjoyment, underground doctors , and...... a headless black biker. Together, these strange characters tell a very unusual story, and very intriguing one at that. This is a twisted story, however, they still can talk about love. </p>
