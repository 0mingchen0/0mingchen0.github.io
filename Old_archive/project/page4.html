    <p>Prologue</p>
    <p>
“It’s so exciting! So exciting! So very exciting! There are still so many things I don’t know about in this city! Even as I speak, something new is appearing, emerging, and something else is fading away. How can I leave a place where so many humans gather? HUMAN LOVE! I love humans! I love you all!

In Ikebukuro, Tokyo, strange groups of people gather: youths who yearn for an extraordinary life, trouble-making hooligans, crazy stalker girls, informants who sell information for their own enjoyment, underground doctors who treat unconventional ‘ailments’, high schoolers obsessed with the occult and, of course, a headless black biker.

Together, these strange characters tell a very unusual story, and very intriguing one at that. Twisted as they are, however, they still can talk about love.

This is a twisted story.
</p>
<p>“Seiji-san! Seiji-san! Are you home? I’m here again! Oh my, you accidentally locked the door again? Now I can’t get in!”
Danger, danger. The stalker has invaded my home. She’s been banging on my door and she won’t even ring the doorbell. What the hell is she thinking?

“The door’s locked! Seiji-san, you aren’t sleeping, are you? Ah—it’s my first time calling on a guy while he’s asleep! I’m so bold!”

Warning, warning…I’ve been on my toes since last week. Last week I saved two bumpkins from being harassed by some hooligan. I’d asked and found out that they were going to the same high school as I was and would be studying in the same first-year class. But I never expected for things to turn out this way. The other girl was a polite little goody two shoes, but this one…

“Well…actually I…I’ve always liked Seiji-san! Do you remember? During the entrance exam, I was sitting right beside Seiji-san! The guy sitting to my right had this totally awesome name like ‘Ryuugamine Mikado’ and I wanted to know what kind of name the person on my left had, so I turned and—it was love at first sight! From that day on I’ve always remembered Seiji-san’s name! Even though I didn’t have the guts to confess to you that day…but just last week, Seiji-san saved me, and then I thought at that moment…ah, this must be fate! Do you know how much courage that gave me? So– So, let me look at you again, won’t you? Seiji-san, I really want to look at that strong, energetic face of yours! Please please, pretty please, Seiji-san!”</p>
